            <h1>My Favorite Hobby: Making Videos & Taking Pictures</h1>

            <br>
            <p>My favorite hobby is filming short videos and sometimes editing them. Making videos helps me show my creativity and skill because videos can be made in many different ways but it takes skill to properly film and edit them so that they look good. I also enjoy taking photographs and sometimes editing them. Photography is an art form and photographers can be creative. There are many different cameras and many different attachments that can be used to take photographs. Random Historical Fact: The first picture that shows a person was of the Boulevard du Temple street in Paris, France. It was taken in 1831 and in the picture, a man can be seen shining another person's shoes. Lastly, I like to read about photography & filmaking. It is my favorite hobby and I enjoy it.</p>
